# CMPE202
CMPE202 Project File Repo

The majority of this project was spent in debugging complex build processes and trying to understand how we can deploy models to alternative hardware (the DSP primarily) from the Tensorflow environment. However in each of the cases, attempting to get the build environments to work required some tweaking of existing code. I have published this code to github, however note that most of the actual code is not mine, most of it is in the form of demo’s. Where I have needed to make changes to solve problems in the build processes I have noted my name, “David Parks” in a comment along with some reference to the original code. This may serve as a proxy to understanding some of the long debugging processes that were followed in this project.
